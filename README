NAME

Apache::RequestNotes - extract cookies and CGI form parameters for 
                       each request.

SYNOPSIS

  httpd.conf:

    PerlInitHandler Apache::RequestNotes
    PerlSetVar MaxPostSize 1024

  MaxUploadSize is in bytes and defaults to 1024.

DESCRIPTION

  Apache::RequestNotes provides a simple interface allowing all parts
  of the request cycle access to cookie or CGI input parameters in a 
  consistent manner.

EXAMPLE

  some Perl*Handler or Registry script:

    my $cookies           = $r->pnotes('COOKIES');
    my %cookies           = %$cookies;
    my $input             = $r->pnotes('INPUT');
    my %input             = %$input;

  httpd.conf:

    PerlInitHandler Apache::RequestNotes
    PerlSetVar MaxUploadSize 1024

  After using Apache::RequestNotes and dereferencing the hashes, 
  %input will contain both GET and POST data, and %cookies will
  contain the names and values of all cookies sent back to your domain
  and path.  Once the request is past the PerlInit phase, all other
  phases can have access to form input and cookie data without parsing
  it themselves. This relieves some strain, especially when the GET or 
  POST data is required by numerous handlers along the way.

NOTES

  Apache::RequestNotes does not allow for file uploads. If either a 
  file upload was attempted, or the POST data exceeds MaxPostSize,
  rather than barf it sets $r->pnotes('PARSE_ERROR').

  Verbose debugging is enabled by setting the variable
  $Apache::RequestNotes::DEBUG=1 to or greater. To turn off all debug
  information, set your apache LogLevel above info level.

  This is alpha software, and as such has not been tested on multiple
  platforms or environments.  It requires PERL_INIT=1, PERL_LOG_API=1, 
  and maybe other hooks to function properly.  Doug MacEachern's 
  libapreq is also required - you can get it from CPAN under the 
  Apache tree.

FEATURES/BUGS

  When parsing forms with duplicate keys some data is lost.
